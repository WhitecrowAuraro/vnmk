# This is an example file for configuring the VNMK server.
#
# This file is written in YAML format. Read
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
# to understand how it should be formatted...simple!
#
# To get started, change following configurations as you need. Then start the
# server using:
#
#   python3 -m vnmk.server <PATH TO THIS YAML FILE> --init
#
#                                                   ^^^^^^
#                                                   |
#                      Option "--init" must be used for first call, and must
#                      not be used for further calls.
#
# By using the "--init" option, server (re)initializes the entries in firebase,
# and sets the system to GROUND state. The server then stops and asks you
# to restart it without this option.


# HTTP server which this system listens to.
server:
    addr: localhost
    port: 80

# Path to the credential file, which will be served over HTTP upon successful
# authentication, or deleted upon authentication failure.
credential: credential/credential.test

# The correct authentication code.
authcode: 123456 # Must be at least 3 characters!!

# User id. Access to login page will be https://localhost/<userid>/
userid: test

# Timeouts for 2 states. Timing out without successful login results in
# credential being destroyed.
timeouts: 
    ground: 604800    # 7 days 
    excited: 3600     # 1 hour 



# For authentication, you need both a Telegram bot and a Firebase setup.
#
# Telegram is used for Step 1 Activation, the system will not allow any access
# when not in activated(excited) state. This process also guarantees the user
# get informed via Telegram for any login attempt and further system state
# updates.
#
# Firebase is used for persisting system state, and for user authentication
# in Step 2.
